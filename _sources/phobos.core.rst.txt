phobos core package
===================

phobos.core.Robot is the general class to represent robots. It inherits io.smurfrobot (which inherits io.xmlrobot) and
thereby is the wrapper for robots in any model format. The Robot class offers all format unrelated utilities to create,
edit and annotate a robot representation.
Also it provides access to the export functionalities off the different model file formats.
